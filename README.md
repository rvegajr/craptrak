# Dice Roll Tracker

Dice Roll Tracker is a React application designed for tracking the history of dice rolls. It's perfect for board game enthusiasts and anyone who needs to keep track of dice outcomes with the ability to review, select, and remove rolls from the history.

## Features

- Roll two dice and automatically record each roll with a unique history entry.
- Select a roll from the history to highlight and potentially modify it.
- Confirm deletion of rolls with a 'Yes' or 'No' prompt to prevent accidental removal.

- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use.
